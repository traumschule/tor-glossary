The Tor Glossary is a glossary used primarily when translating software
and documentation for the Tor Project. This glossary contains technical,
general, gui and Tor specific terms as well as names. This glossary can
also be used for a more consistent use of technical terms in the source
language (English).

Translators will be able to access this glossary from inside Transifex,
when working on a resource. There is no need to clone this repository or
keep the glossary list open while translating.

The work on the Tor Glossary was initially started by Shondoit Walker on
