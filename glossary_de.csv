Two-factor authentication
""Something you know, and something you have."" Login systems that require only a username and password risk being broken when someone else can obtain (or guess) those pieces of information. Services that offer two-factor authentication also require you to provide a separate confirmation that you are who you say you are. The second factor could be a one-off secret code, a number generated by a program running on a mobile device, or a device that you carry and that you can use to confirm who you are. Companies like banks, and major internet services like Google, Paypal and Twitter now offer two-factor authentication.

Command-line tool,Noun,"The ""command line"" is an ancient way of giving a computer a series of small, self-contained orders (think of those science fiction movies where teenage geniuses type long strings of green text onto black screens). To use a command line tool, the user types a command into a window called a terminal emulator, hits the return or enter key, and then receives a textual response in the same window. Windows, Linux and Apple desktop computers still let you run software using this interface, and even some mobile phones can do the same with the right app. The command line can be used to run software pre-packaged with your operating system. Some downloadable programs, especially technical utilities, use the command line instead of a more familiar ""icons and buttons"" user interface. The command line needn't be scary, but it does require you to type in exactly the right set of letters and numbers to get the correct result, and it's often unclear what to do if the responses don't match your expectations.

It's usually safer (and often easier) to use full disk encryption than to manage just a few individually encrypted files. If you try to encrypt just individual files, your computer might make temporary unencrypted copies of those files without you noticing. And some software might keep some unencrypted records about your use of your computer. Apple's OS X, Linux and high-end versions of Windows all have built-in full disk encryption, but it is usually not turned on by default.

Key verification,Noun,"In public key cryptography, each person has a set of keys. To send a message securely to a particular person, you encrypt your message using their public key. An attacker may be able to trick you into using their key, which means that they will be able to read your message, instead of the intended recipient.

Key-signing party,Noun,"When you're using public key encryption, it's important to be sure that the key you use to encrypt a message really belongs to the recipient (see key verification). PGP makes this a little easier by having a way to tell others ""I believe this key belongs to this person -- and if you trust me, you should believe that too."" Telling the world that you trust someone's key is called ""signing their key"": it means anyone who uses that key can see you vouched for it. To encourage everyone to check and sign each others keys, PGP users organize key-signing parties. They're almost, but not quite, as exciting as they sound.

He was formally investigated by the US government when the program spread outside the United States. At the time, exporting tools that included strong public key encryption was a violation of US law.
PGP continues to exist as a commercial software product. A free implementation of the same underlying standard that PGP uses called GnuPG (or GPG) is also available. Because both use the same interchangeable approach, people will refer to using a “PGP key” or sending a “PGP message”, even if they are using GnuPG. (Synonyms: PGP) (Source: EFF)",

So if I encrypted a file with the password ""bluetonicmonster"", you would need both the file and the secret ""bluetonicmonster"" to decode it. Public key encryption uses two keys: one to encrypt, and another to decrypt. This has all kinds of useful consequences. For one, it means that you can hand out the key to encrypt messages to you, and as long as you keep the other key secret, anyone with that key can talk to you securely. The key you hand out widely is known as the ""public key"": hence the name of the technique. Public key encryption is used to encrypt email and files by Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), OTR for  messaging, and SSL/TLS for web browsing.
Synonyms: Asymmetric key encryption, Public key cryptography.

Public key servers,Noun,"If you plan to send a secure message to someone who uses public key cryptography like PGP, you need to know what key to use to encrypt your message. Public key servers act as a phonebook for such keys, allowing software to use an email address, name, or key fingerprint to search for a full key and download it. There are many PGP public key servers, but they usually share their key collections with each other. Keyservers can't verify whether the keys they publish are genuine or forgeries. Anyone can upload a key to a public key server—in anyone's name. That means that a key connected to a person's name or email on a keyserver might not be their real key. In order to check the authenticity of a key, you need to check its signatures, or confirm its fingerprint with the original user in a trustworthy way.

PGP allows you to sign other people's keys, which is a way of using your own key to assert that a certain key is the right one to use to contact another person. This is meant to provide a way of distinguishing between genuine and fake keys; if people sign the right keys for people they know and communicate with, others can use those signatures to confirm that the genuine keys are genuine. When you download a key from a key server, it may include signatures from other people who affirm that it's the right one. If you know those people and know that you have the right key for them, you can have more confidence in the newly downloaded key. This verification process is also called the web of trust. Its advantage is that it's decentralized and not controlled by any authority, so you don't have to believe a certain company or government about which keys to use when writing to new people. Instead, you can believe your own social networks. One important disadvantage of the web of trust is that publishing signatures for other people's keys tells the whole world who your contacts are; it creates public evidence that you know particular people. Also, using the web of trust correctly requires a good deal of time and attention, and some communities rarely or never participate. (Source: EFF)",

A VPN may be hosted in a foreign country, which is useful both for protecting communications from a local government, and bypassing national censorship. The down side is that most of the traffic is decrypted at the commercial VPN's end. That means you need to trust the commercial VPN (and the country where it is located) not to snoop on your traffic.

An example of such an attack is tricking an employee to install malware on their laptop. To allow employees to access the intranet via the wider Internet, companies will often provide their own Virtual Private Network (VPN) which creates a secure connection to the inside of the intranet from anywhere in the world.

PGP makes this a little easier by having a way to tell others ""I believe this key belongs to this person -- and if you trust me, you should believe that too."" Telling the world that you trust someone's key is called ""signing their key"": it means anyone who uses that key can see you vouched for it. To encourage everyone to check and sign each others keys, PGP users organize key-signing parties. They're almost, but not quite, as exciting as they sound.
Analogy: It's like a networking party, where you introduce your friends to other friends.

fingerprint,Noun,"[Orbot] The keys of public key cryptography are very large numbers, sometimes a thousand or more digits long. A fingerprint is a much smaller number or set of numbers and letters that can be used as a unique name for that key, without having to list all of the key's digits. So, for instance, if you and a friend wished to make sure you both had the same key, you could either spend a long time reading off all the hundreds of digits in the key, or you could each calculate your key's fingerprint and compare those instead. The fingerprints presented by cryptographic software usually consist of around 40 letters and numbers. If you carefully check that a fingerprint has the right value, you should be safe against impersonation using a fake key. Some software tools may offer more convenient alternative ways to verify a friend's key, but some form of verification needs to happen to prevent communications providers from easily being able to listen in.

wear leveling,Noun,"Some forms of digital storage, like the flash memory used in solid-state drives (SSD) and USB sticks, can wear out if overwritten many times. Wear leveling is a method that spreads the writing of data evenly across all of the media to prevent one part of it being overwritten too many times. Its benefit is that it can make devices last longer. The danger for security-conscious users is that wear leveling interferes with secure erase programs, which deliberately try to overwrite sensitive files with junk data in order to permanently erase them. Rather than trusting secure erase programs with files stored on SSD or USB flash drives, it can be better to use full-disk encryption. Encryption avoids the difficulty of secure erasing by making any file on the drive difficult to recover without the correct passphrase.
